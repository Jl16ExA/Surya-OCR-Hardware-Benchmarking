# Surya-OCR-Hardware-Benchmarking
Surya-OCR-Hardware-Benchmarking is a repository dedicated to evaluating and analyzing the performance of the Surya OCR model across different hardware configurations. It provides tools and scripts for benchmarking GPU and CPU performance with various batch sizes, aiming to optimize OCR tasks for efficiency and speed in real-world applications.

This is still an early version I made in a Friday evening only testing a single image being processed in different batch sizes.

If you have any questions or wish to collaborate, feel free to reach out via my social media platforms. I am always eager to discuss and help.
